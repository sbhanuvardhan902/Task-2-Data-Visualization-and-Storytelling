# Task-2-Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling
This project focuses on visualizing sales data from the Superstore dataset using Tableau/Power BI. The goal was to uncover key business insights through clear and engaging dashboards. The visualizations highlight trends in sales, profits, regional performance, and product categories, supported by a summary slide to tell a concise data story.
